     <p><b> 3T Cancellation policies </b></p><br>
 <p><b>Note:</b> These policies apply to projects from UCSD or non-profit research institutions that have a partnership agreement with UCSD. Cancellation fees can be applied to other
  projects at the discretion of the Center. </p><br>

<p>1. Lost hours: We define lost hours as time-slots that go unused but were previously reserved by a PI for more than 2 hours during the previous 30 days. The 2-hour clause provides 
the opportunity for a PI to hold a slot briefly to confirm that it can be used, and as long as the PI cancels the slot within 2 hours they incur no responsibility for that slot. 
If a PI cancels a reserved slot and another PI reserves the slot, the first PI no longer has any responsibility for that slot. Otherwise, the PI is responsible for lost hours attributed to 
that project. Each month the responsible lost hours will be tallied for each project.</p><br>

<p>2. Funded hours: Each month we will also tally the funded hours used by each project.</p><br>

<p>3. Rewards and Penalties: We have targeted an acceptable level of lost hours as 25% of the funded hours.  
The Center will calculate the number of potential pilot hours at a rate of 25% of funded hours used by each project.  To calculate the number of net pilot hours, the Center will subtract 
the number of lost hours from the number of potential pilot hours (e.g. net pilot hours = potential pilot hours - lost hours).  If the number of net pilot hours is greater than zero, 
then these pilot hours will be added to the PI?s pilot hour account.  If the number of net pilot hours is less than zero, then these pilot hours will be subtracted from the PI's pilot hours account.</p><br>

<p>4. Reconciliation of accounts. If a project consistently performs worse than the 25% level, it is possible for the pilot hour account to go negative. Periodically we will reconcile all accounts for 
a PI, removing pilot hours from their other accounts if necessary to offset the deficit in accounts that have gone negative. In this way, the average performance of the PI's full suite of projects 
is required to meet a lost hours percentage of no more than 25%. If a PI cannot meet this goal, then we will have to introduce new policies limiting that PI's freedom in scheduling. 
At this point we hope that will not be necessary.</p><br>

<p>Examples: For a project that accrues 32 funded hours of scanner time, the maximum number of lost hours is 8. If the project has no lost hours, it will be awarded 8 pilot hours. 
For 5 lost hours, the project will be awarded 3 pilot hours. If the project is responsible for 10 lost hours, then 2 hours will be deducted from the project's pilot hour account. </p><br>
